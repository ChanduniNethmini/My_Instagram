# My_Instagram
I completed a social media web application that is similar to Instagram during my leisure time. This is the MERN stack application in which users can register to the system, create their own profile, upload and delete posts, view others' posts, comment, like and unlike others' posts, and follow and unfollow others. Here I mainly focused on the security and authentication of the application. Also, both frontend and backend are deployed.

Technologies:
- ReactJS, NodeJS, ExpressJS, MongoDB
- Cloudinary, JWT token, bcrypt, password hashing
- vercel.com, circleCI
Tools :
- VS code, postman, GitHub
